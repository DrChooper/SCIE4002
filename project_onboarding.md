# Project Onboarding

Welcome to your SCIE4002 group research project. This document provides a common starting point for all groups and outlines the steps needed to begin your analysis.

Find your team members and establish the best times and ways to communicate. We will meet in the seminar #1 in order to discuss starting points for the projects. The seminars facilitate the group work, they are not teaching lessons. Each seminar will have up to 5 groups (A, B, C, D, E) totally 20 students working on the same data set. While you have the same data, you can form distinct hypotheses and design the analysis towards the solving of your questions. Discussing your questions and apporaches with other groups will allow you to gain a better understanding of the dataset.  


**The first seminar will allow the team members to discuss starting points and role distribution** Check LMS for the rooms and time slots of your project. 



## 1. Project Briefs

Each group receives:
- **Project Brief** The description of the data and circumstances.
- **Datasets:** Genomic data either raw or prepared for analysis.
- **Background & Hypotheses:** Context for your assigned project.


## 2. Getting Started

- **Read the project brief** and understand the dataset provided.
- **Assign roles** within your group (Student 1–4 tasks with comparable workload).
- **Access the server** with your project data and set up spaces for your files and scripts.
- **Agree on timelines** and regular check-in meetings.

## 3. Expectations

- Collaboration and communication are essential professional skills.
- Each student is **responsible for their own written report focussed on analysis they performed**.
- Group deliverables (summaries, combined interpretations) must be completed fairly and on time.
- Ensure clear documentaiton for reproducibility.


## 4. Deliverables

- Individual analysis outputs (trees, tables, assemblies, distance plots).
- Short discussion text (150–200 words per student).
- One **group summary paragraph** combining all evidence.
- Participation and teamwork (in-class, teams channel).

---

## 5. Support

- Project discussions within the group can be held in Teams for ongoing collaboration. 
- Seminar meetings bring together different groups working on the same project to share perspectives. (If you want to create a seminar teams channel you are welcome to do so)
- Contact your project tutor promptly if a group member drops out or any issues arise to allow timely solutions.

> **Tip:** Treat this as real research. Document every step, share responsibilities, and communicate frequently. These skills are as important as the final results.

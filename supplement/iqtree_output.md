## IQ-TREE2 Output Summary â€“ rpoC2

Analysis:
- Input: 11 sequences, 1421 codon sites
- Type: Codon-based maximum likelihood tree
- ModelFinder used for model selection
- 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates
- 1000 SH-aLRT replicates
- Model selected: MG+F1X4+G4

Alignment statistics:
- Constant sites: 410 (28.9%)
- Parsimony-informative sites: 550
- Distinct site patterns: 1088

Maximum likelihood tree:
- Log-likelihood: -18096.8
- Total tree length: 2.35 (substitutions per codon site)
- SH-aLRT and bootstrap support values included at nodes
- Tree is unrooted by default
- Newick format tree saved in: rpoC2.codon.msa.treefile

Consensus tree:
- Constructed from 1000 bootstrap trees
- Identical to ML tree (Robinson-Foulds distance = 0)
- Consensus Newick tree embedded in .iqtree file

Timing:
- Tree search wall-clock time: 1 min 17 sec
- Tree search CPU time: 10 min 9 sec
- Total wall-clock time: 2 min 11 sec
- Total CPU time: 17 min 22 sec using 8 threads

Interpretation notes:
- Tree is unrooted; use a known outgroup (e.g. Liriodendron) to root
- Codon model captures reading-frame-specific substitution patterns
- All nodes show high support (mostly 100%)
